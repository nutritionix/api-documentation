Nutritionix API Documentation

#### Publishing Changes to Gist

Once you've made changes you need to use `gistup publish` command to push the docs to a gist.

It will prompt you to login using a personal access token.
![login](http://take.ms/FR8HZ)

You can acquire a `personal access token` by going to the `nutritionix-docs` github account settings page.
However, one should have already been provided in a previous email sent to Nutritionix documentation staff.
